## Features

- **Data Exploration**: We've meticulously analyzed and cleaned a rich dataset of used car information to ensure accurate predictions.

- **Machine Learning Magic**: Leveraging a variety of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression, we've fine-tuned our models for optimal performance.

- **Interactive Interface**: We've developed an interactive user interface that allows you to input car specifications and receive a predicted price in real-time.

- **Model Evaluation**: We provide detailed insights into the evaluation metrics of each model, giving you a clear understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.
